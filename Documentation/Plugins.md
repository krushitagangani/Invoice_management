> Review Notes:
================
- replace plugin with artifact
- nodeJS - needed only for async processes
- decide framework based on flow and prcesses (E.g. async/sync processes)
- have you realeted resourses in the team?
- take a look on your budget
- functionality ne framework uper thi break karo (e.g. email handeling & authentication will be in node.js)
- keep the alternative artifacts too
- check the artifact carefully (maintanence, cost, skill, repairs)
- check updates (active framework)
